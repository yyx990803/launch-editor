# launch-editor

Open file with line numbers in editor from Node.js.

The main functionality is extracted from [react-dev-utils](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-dev-utils/launchEditor.js) with slight modifications so that it can be used as a standalone package. The original source code is licensed under MIT.

Also added column number support.

## Why

There are also a few other existing packages with the same purpose:

- [lahmatiy/open-in-editor](https://github.com/lahmatiy/open-in-editor)
- [sindresorhus/open-editor](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-editor)

However, both expects env variables like `EDITOR` to be set in order to open files. This package infers the editor to open by checking current running processes before falling back to env variables.

On the other hand,`react-dev-utils` includes many other utilities and dependencies and is thus not suitable for standalone usage.

## Usage

```js
const launch = require('launch-editor')

launch(
  // filename:line:column
  // both line and column are optional
  // `file://` URIs are also supported
  'foo.js:12:34',
  // try specific editor bin first (optional)
  'code',
  // callback if failed to launch (optional)
  (fileName, errorMsg) => {
    // log error if any
  }
)
```

### Middleware

An express/connect/webpack-dev-server compatible middleware is also available:

``` js
const launchMiddleware = require('launch-editor-middleware')

app.use('/__open-in-editor', launchMiddleware())
```

The middleware factory function accepts the following arguments (all optional, the callback can be in any position as long as it's the last argument):

1. A specific editor bin to try first. Defaults to inferring from running processes, then fallback to env variables like `EDITOR` and `VISUAL`.
2. The root directory of source files, in case the file path is relative. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
3. a callback when it fails to launch the editor.

To launch files, send requests to the server like the following:

```text
/__open-in-editor?file=src/main.js:13:24
```

### Custom editor support

You can use the `LAUNCH_EDITOR` environment variable

#### to force a specific supported editor

```bash
LAUNCH_EDITOR=codium
```

#### to run a custom launch script

```bash
LAUNCH_EDITOR=my-editor-launcher.sh
```

```shell
# gets called with 3 args: filename, line, column
filename=$1
line=$2
column=$3

# call your editor with whatever args it expects
my-editor -l $line -c $column -f $filename
```
